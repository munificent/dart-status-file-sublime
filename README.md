This is a Sublime Package for Dart Status Files.

It's not on Package Control because it's not likely to be useful for anyone not
actually on the Dart team. You can install it locally by cloning this repo into
your "Packages/User" directory inside your Sublime installation.

On a Mac, that's:

```sh
$ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/
$ git clone https://github.com/munificent/dart-status-file-sublime.git
```
